# Study Mood Checker ðŸ§ ðŸ“š

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that checks whether I'm in the mood to study based on three personal factors:
- Whether I like the subject
- Whether I feel pressure
- Whether I'm motivated

The logic reflects *how I actually function* â€” for example, I study better when I'm under pressure, even if motivation is low.  
This project helped me practice using boolean values (`True`, `False`), logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), and build custom logic around real situations.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to define and combine boolean variables
- How to use logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`
- How to represent real-life thinking patterns in code
- How to debug small syntax issues (like string + boolean)
